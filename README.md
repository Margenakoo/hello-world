Clausewitz outline grapher

About the me (that's me who I'm talking about not any other me ou there). i used to wander around github like a ghost of an Eskimo would  in Disney land, and i will continue to do so. here is what i can do: i am a novelist with extensive experience in word editors, this means i can write (text not code) and that if you are working in a tool for writers you can ask me stuff on the subject matter, i will awnser. most word editors I've seen clearly never to consult a writer, a weird phenomenon imo, but what can you do?
other stuff: i can draw (ikr? so much talent in one human, please don't blame my parents, it was god that made me this way) so i can make pretty logos icons and what not.
I'm here now, in github, githubbing like never beforee. Maybe i can be usefull, 
i will be drawing foundational plans for a android Editor
